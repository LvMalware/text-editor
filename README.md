> A simple command-line text editor

This a simple command-line text editor that I wrote using [Build your own Text Editor](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x#build-your-own-text-editor) as reference. It is basically a modified version of [antirezâ€™s kilo](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x#build-your-own-text-editor).

The goal was not create a full-blown text editor, but rather use it to exercise C programming (and for fun, of course).

For now, syntax highlight is only supported for C and Perl, but I plan to add more languages later.

You can use this editor to edit simple files if you want, but it still lacks some important features to become a suitable text editor for programmers (like copy and paste) and surely can't replace an IDE, but I still find it pretty fun to use.

If you want to contribute, here is a list of cool features that would be very appreciated:
- display line numbers
- support for a config file
- line wrap
- copy and paste
- multiple tabs
- more languages

# TODO
- fix the display when terminal is resized
